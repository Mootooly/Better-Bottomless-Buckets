# Better Bottomless Buckets
  
This mod adds more bottomless buckets into the game.

Each bucket can be crafted at the type of liquid you want to fill it with using a bottomless bucket.

Sadly the bottomless bucket does not do anything except for craft the other buckets because i dont know how to code that in.

I also couldn't get the Bottomles Water Bucket to be craftable.
